# apt-installed-list
This will generate a list of all installed packages and their details, including the package name, version, and description, and store it in the file installed-packages.txt.

To use this script, save it to a file with a .sh extension (e.g. store-installed-packages.sh) and make it executable using the chmod command:
    chmod +x store-installed-packages.sh

You can then run the script using the ./ command:

./store-installed-packages.sh
